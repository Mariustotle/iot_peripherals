Please give me a WIKI README formatted overview of XXXXXX that include the following sections. Assume this is in context of a Raspbery Pi and Python where applicable:

- Name of peripheral: Single sentance introduction
- Overview: What is the peripheral, how does it work and what are practival uses for it
- Hardware configuration: Pin configuration, communication modules needed (I2C, ADC, etc)
- Software configuration
  - Bash: How to test the peripheral from console / CLI
  - Code: How to test using Python


### Hardware Configuration

Pin functions (XXXXXXX):

- S - Signal / Data
- VCC - 5V Power
- [-] - Ground


## Configuration

```json

    "Sensors" : {
        "TypeOfSensor" :
        [
            {
                "name": "Purpose or location",
                "driver": null,
                "gpio_pin": 12
            }
        ],
    }

```

## Software Configuration

### Testing from Bash

```bash
# Bash / CLI Code here
```

### Testing from Python

```python
# Python code come shere
```
