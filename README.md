# Peripheral Submodule
This project can be referenced in other projects to facilitate the communication between software and the hardware (Drivers and request/response contracts).

You can test the peripherals out using the [Universal IOT Hub](https://github.com/Mariustotle/universal_iot_hub) project, this will allow you to see the interaction with a simulator or test it via a console menu and then use this submodule in the actual project.

You can browse the available [peripherals here](peripheral_index.md).
